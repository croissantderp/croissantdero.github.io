                Greetings! I am Yiunfan Hu, class of 2024 at Ward Melville High School (NY), and formerly at Gunn High School (CA). I always had a passion for creating things from scratch, either grand or petit, solo or as a team. I play with engineering, 3D design, coding, music, graphic design, fabric arts, and more.

                One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from
                anxious dreams, he discovered that in bed he had been
                changed into a monstrous verminous bug. He lay on his
                armour-hard back and saw, as he lifted his head up a little,

                his brown, arched abdomen divided up into rigid bow-
                like sections. From this height the blanket, just about

                ready to slide off completely, could hardly stay in place.
                His numerous legs, pitifully thin in comparison to the rest
                of his circumference, flickered helplessly before his eyes.
                ‘What’s happened to me,’ he thought. It was no dream.
                His room, a proper room for a human being, only

                somewhat too small, lay quietly between the four well-
                known walls. Above the table, on which an unpacked

                collection of sample cloth goods was spread out (Samsa
                was a traveling salesman) hung the picture which he had
                cut out of an illustrated magazine a little while ago and set
                in a pretty gilt frame. It was a picture of a woman with a
                fur hat and a fur boa. She sat erect there, lifting up in the
                direction of the viewer a solid fur muff into which her
                entire forearm disappeared.
