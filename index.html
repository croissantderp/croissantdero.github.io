                    Greetings! I am Yiunfan Hu, class of 2024 at Ward Melville High School (NY), and formerly at Gunn High School (CA). I always had a passion for creating things from scratch, either grand or petit, solo or as a team. I play with engineering, 3D design, coding, music, graphic design, fabric arts, and more.

                    Greetings! I am Yiunfan Hu, currently a student, class of 2024, at Ward Melville High School in New York and formerly at Gunn High School in California.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to make. No matter if it is a 3D printed engineering project, a fractal generating program, or music for a string orchestra, I have a passion for creating anything that piques my interest. When I am met with something new and unfamiliar, I am driven to research and make myself acquainted. I play with engineering, 3D printing, web and backend coding, music, graphic design, farbic arts, and more.

                    With ample time and boredom during the opening months of the Covid-19 Pandemic, I was able to properly invest into my interests. After acquiring a new 3D printer, I spent the following few months learning how to use it. Not content with just printing the works of others, I sought to create my own designs. Using Autodeks Inventor, my first project was a series of interlocking tubes for my geckos to climb. I pressed on, and with every project, I picked up new skills and applied lessons learned from previous projects.

                    Almost five years later, I have come a long way. I continue to build upon those years of experience, and seek new opportunities. After moving to New York shortly before ninth grade, I joined the principles of engineering class at Ward Melville, and excelled. The next year, I joined the school robotics team and served as the head of CAD and design. Outside of school, I design 3D printable alternatives to often expensive lab equipment. My work there has been used in research, and derived by others for other, new, purposes. I have also sought opportunties to present my knowledge, presenting an introductionary 3D design workshop at Stony Brook on Inventor and 3D printing.

                    Like with my interest in engineering, my programming journey began much the same way. School resumed virtually after a shaky few months of quarantine, along with some clubs and events. My most attended club was United Computations, the computer science club. At the time, I was not too familiar with computer science despite living in the heart of Silicon Valley. I had made attempts to learn how to code in the past, but nothing really stuck until now. My concurrent interest in game development had led me to learn C# in the context of The Unity Game Engine. However, it was one UC meeting that inspired me to pursue learning C# as a full programming language. This came from the lesson on creating Discord bots. As the coronavirus kept us apart, Discord became the popular space that we would connect in. It was the idea that programming could be used in an immediate and important application, that inspired me to pick up computer science as a whole. Geckobot, a Discord bot, was my first project, but I soon picked up the dotnet ecosystem as a whole to explore different fields like image processing, APIs, and genetic algorithms. During the summer of 2021, I formally took CS50x, the online introductary course to computer science offered by Harvard. This added C and python to my toolkit, as well as leading me down web development and making this very website.

                    United computations holds an annual hackathon during the spring, GunnHacks. In ninth grade, a group of friends and I decided to participate as a team. After a day and a half of ideas, design, and code, we created Well Chess but Actually No, a Unity-based online chess platform where the players would select modifiers that added special rules or gimmicks. Even after moving to New York, I participated as an organizer for the next iteration of GunnHacks. In 2023, I travelled back to help out in person. Like with engineering, I used the opportunity to give a workshop on where I got my start, Unity, even becoming the most highly anticipated workshop of the event.

                    As an aside, I was specifically a publicity organizer for gunnHacks, and I designed the posters, t-shirt, and flyers for GunnHacks. I first got interested in graphic design through learning of a piece of software called Figma from a friend. I would use this new tool for everything from designing icons for my websites to making a menu for a French project. After learning how to use the tool during my first year as an organizer, I became the leading designer of the publicity team, designing the base for flyers and the t-shirt. Since then, I have also been asked by peers to help out with logo and website design.

                    Speaking of, art is another key interest of my life. I was first exposed to the violin around 2010, and I have steadily been continuing my musical education since. I have actively seeked out opportunities to demonstrate my skill whenever possible, I was a member of the district honor orchestra in 4th and 5th grade, continuing on to the Fletcher Chamber Orchestra in 6th through 8th, the California All-State Junior High Orchestra in 8th, and the Ward Melville Chamber Orchestra from 10th to 12th. In 7th, I explored composing and arranging music alongside violin, leading me to arrange a rendition of Megalovania by Toby Fox which we sightread in orchestra. For the previously mentioned Hackathon project, I also composed the OST, which received positive reviews. Other than music, I have a keen interest in fabric arts, crochet, and as mentioned, graphic design. I first learned how to sew from my mother, and crochet from my grandmother. Following mastery of the basic skills, with much of the same passion that drives my other interests, I went from making pillows, to a comforter, then to a full-body cloak, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I move into the next stage of my life, I hope to be able to continue my passion for creation, to build upon my skills, to explore new interests, and to ultimately do what I enjoy.
