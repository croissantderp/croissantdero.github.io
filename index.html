                    Greetings! I am Yiunfan Hu, class of 2024 at Ward Melville High School (NY), and formerly at Gunn High School (CA). I have a passion for creating things from scratch, either grand or petit, solo or as a team. I play with engineering, 3D design, coding, music, graphic design, fabric arts, and more.

                <p>
                    Greetings! I am Yiunfan Hu, currently a student, class of 2024, at Ward Melville High School in New York and formerly at Gunn High School in California.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a maker. I have cultivated an affinity for creation since I was a kid, starting with small projects such as sewing, crocheting, and making bows and arrows using tree branches nearby my house. Over the years, I have developed more skills, taught myself how to code, learned CAD and 3D printing, and played with music arrangement and composing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it feels great to enrich my toolbox, I find myself more into the idea of making things rather than specific skills. Whether it is engineering a homemade air purifier, a fractal generating program, or a music piece for a string orchestra, I love the entire process, from developing ideas, researching information, and troubleshooting problems, to eventually realizing the finished product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My experience living in multiple cities on both coasts significantly shaped my journey as a maker. Moving from MA to CA, and now to NY, I have an extensive record of transfers – attending two kindergartens, two elementary schools, and two high schools. My exposure to different environments and cultures provides an opportunity for me to break the mold, restart a network, and pick up new expertise. Using this advantage, I mastered coding in Palo Alto, CA, the heart of Silicon Valley, and engineering robotics in Long Island, NY.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I further advanced my development during the Covid-19 pandemic. With ample spare time at home, I took apart my first 3D printer and gained a thorough understanding of how it works. I taught myself how to CAD. I started coding at about the same time and completed CS50x, a well-known introductory computer science course offered by Harvard. After moving to New York, I continued to learn by involving myself in engineering classes and Robotics, which both would be unavailable to me if I were in Palo Alto. This would not have been possible without the foundation I established during the pandemic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For engineering, I became more serious about it after moving to New York. In 2021, I excelled the Principles of Engineering class at Ward Melville. The following year, I was joined the robotics team and served as the head of CAD and design. Outside of school, I design 3D printable alternatives to often expensive lab equipment, with many of them gaining significant traction. I have also sought opportunities to demonstrate my knowledge, presenting an introductory 3D design workshop at Stony Brook on Inventor and 3D printing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For computer science, my interest began with the simple idea of making a Discord bot, Geckobot. Later, I picked up the dotnet ecosystem to explore more fields such as image processing, APIs, and genetic algorithms. During the summer of 2021, I added C and Python to my toolkit, studied web development, and launched this website. I am also actively involved in the hackathon hosted by Gunn High School, GunnHacks, a 24-hour event where people engage in rapid and collaborative coding. I participated as a competitor in 2021 and returned from NY to CA as an organizer in 2022 and 2023. I also held a Unity workshop on video game design at the 2023 event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For art, it is another interest in my life. I was first exposed to the violin when I was 6, and I have steadily continued my musical education since. I have actively sought out opportunities to demonstrate my skills whenever possible; I was a member of the district honor orchestra in 4th and 5th grade, continuing to the Fletcher Chamber Orchestra in 6th through 8th, the California All-State Junior High Orchestra in 8th, and the Ward Melville Chamber Orchestra from 10th to 12th. In 7th, I explored composing and arranging music alongside violin, leading me to create an arrangement of Megalovania by Toby Fox, which the school orchestra sight-read. Aside from music, I am also heavily interested in fabric arts, crochet, and graphic design. I first learned how to sew from my mother and crochet from my grandmother.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I move into the next stage of my life, I hope to be able to continue my passion for creation, build upon my skills, explore new interests, and ultimately do what I enjoy.
