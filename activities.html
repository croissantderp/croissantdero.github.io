                <p>
                    In the summer of 2023, I participated in the "Lego Camp". I was able to oversee a large younger group (1st - 6th grade), and inspire creativity by assisting and engaging with them through the medium of Lego.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the camp, to better engage with the students, I spontaneously started some small engineering challenges such as bridge building using Lego bricks. Students were intrigued and engaged significantly with the idea.

                <p>
                    I gave a small workshop on the basics of 3D printing and computer-aided design to undergraduate and graduate students at Stony Brook University.
                </p><p>
                    The workshop consisted of a presentation on the principles of designing models for 3D printing with tangible examples from my own projects, and a live demonstration of CAD using Autodesk Inventor.

                    In the summer of 2022, I participated in the “3D Printing Camp”. I was able to closely interact with a small group of students, help them assemble their Prusa Mini 3D printer kits, and effectively introduce them to the basics of 3D printing.

                <p>In the summer of 2023, I participated in the "Game Development Camp". I was able to introduce the students to the basics of scratch, and to use my game developer experience to help students come up with unique ideas, fix complex bugs, and demonstrate basic principles of game design.</p>

                <h2>2022 - 2023 • Palo Alto, CA</h2>
                <p>
                    I joined GunnHacks 2023 as an organizer. Not only did I participate in the pre-event planning remotely in New York in the fall of 2022, but also, I flew out alone to California to the event in January 2023.
                </p><p>
                    As my second year in a row being an organizer, I acted as the lead graphic designer. I spearheaded the team Figma workplace, designed the advertisement and event t-shirt, and created a post-it mural.
                </p><p>
                    Along with organizing, I also held a highly participated Unity Workshop on the topic “game design and programming in C#”.

                    I joined GunnHacks as an organizer in the fall of 2021. I worked as a member of the publicity team, and designed aspects of the flyer and t-shirt.
                </p><p>
                    This experience was instrumental in developing my graphic design skills, and I would continue to play a larger role as an organizer in later years.

                    I participated in GunnHacks on a team with 3 close friends. We created “Well Chess but Actually No”, a two-player online chess platform with the twist of being able to add funny or game-changing rules to every match.
                </p><p>
                    I acted as the general project manager, coordinated the team, and wrote up the final submission. In addition, I composed the music for the game and contributed ideas. I was inspired to become an organizer the following year after this experience.

                    As a member of the group, I regularly played challenging and professional repertoire. Examples include, Holst’s Jupiter from the Planets, Dvorak’s Symphony No. 9, Rossini’s William Tell Overture, and Shostakovich’s String Quartet No. 8. Notably in the winter of 2021, we were invited to play at the NYSMMA All-State December Conference.
