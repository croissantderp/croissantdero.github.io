                <p>
                    I founded and led a combat robotics team in the National Havoc Robot League (NHRL), an open-to-all combat robotics league hosted nearby in Connecticut.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We designed, manufactured, and built YOB TROHS, a full 12 lb robot from scratch. We then competed in the September 30th event of the 2023 season. I organized and managed the design of the robot, delegated tasks to my team, and communicated necessary changes.

                    I participated in the "Lego Camp" in the summer of 2023. I mentored a large younger group (1st - 6th grade), and inspired creativity by assisting and engaging with them through the medium of Lego.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spontaneously started a series of some small engineering challenges such as bridge building using Lego bricks. Students were intrigued and engaged significantly with the idea.

                    I gave a small workshop on the basics of 3D printing and computer-aided design to undergraduate and graduate students at Stony Brook University.
                </p><p>
                    The workshop consisted of a presentation on the principles of designing models for 3D printing with tangible examples from my own projects, and a live demonstration of CAD using Autodesk Inventor.

                    I participated in the "3D Printing Camp" in the summer of 2022. I mentored with a small group of students, helped them assemble their Prusa Mini 3D printer kits, and effectively introduced them to the basics of 3D printing.

                <p>
                    I have been an organizer of GunnHacks since 2021, designing for and helping to coordinate three Hackathons in three years at Gunn High School, CA.
                </p><p>
                    In 2021, I first joined GunnHacks as an organizer, working on publicity and designing aspects of the flyer and t-shirt. In 2022, I acted as the lead graphic designer. I spearheaded the team Figma workplace, designed the advertisements and event t-shirt, and created a post-it mural. In 2023, I continued to lead the design, creating a new design for the flyer and t-shirt.
                </p><p>
                    Along with organizing, I also held a highly anticipated Unity Workshop on the topic “game design and programming in C#”.

                    Through the help from a teacher from a summer camp opportunity, I am organizing in collaboration with CEWIT at Stony Brook University. I catalyzed the event with my GunnHacks experience with the aim to establish an annual event.

                <p>I participated in the "Game Development Camp" in the Summer of 2023. I introduced the students to the basics of scratch, and to use my game developer experience to help students come up with unique ideas, fix complex bugs, and demonstrate basic principles of game design.</p>

                    I participated in GunnHacks on a team with 3 close friends. We created “Well Chess but Actually No”, a two-player online chess platform with the twist of being able to add funny or game-changing rules to every match.
                </p><p>
                    I acted as the general project manager, coordinated the team, and wrote up the final submission. In addition, I composed the music for the game and contributed ideas. I was inspired to become an organizer the following year after this experience.

                    As a member of the group, I regularly played challenging and professional repertoire.

Notably in the winter of 2021, we were invited to play at the NYSMMA All-State December Conference.
