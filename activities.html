                    I led the CAD team as the sub-team captain, and contributed significantly to the initial designs of the robot. We competed in March at the FIRST Long Island Regional #1, and achieved third place.

                    I joined the Tri-M chapter at Ward Melville in 11th grade. Throughout the school year, I have volunteered at many of the events they hosted, including the Trick or Treat Street, Ward Melville’s Got Talent, and NYSSMA auditions. At the end of the year, I successfully completed 40 hours of service, a NYSSMA All-State audition, and a music project, and was indicted into the honor society.

                    In my first year in New York, I was accepted into the Chamber Orchestra as the only sophomore first violinist. As a member of the group, I regularly played challenging and professional repertoire. Examples include, Holst’s Jupiter from the Planets, Dvorak’s Symphony No. 9, Rossini’s William Tell Overture, and Shostakovich’s String Quartet No. 8. Notably in the winter of 2021, we were invited to play at the NYSMMA All-State December Conference.

                <p>
                    From June to August 2022, I interned at Brookhaven Summer Music. Throughout the weeks, I helped and played along with the young musicians, taught sectionals, and led small ensembles. I returned and volunteered again in the summer of 2023.

                <p>
                    I helped out at the 3D Printing Camp at the Three Village STEM Summer Camp, after I reached out to my engineering teacher about engineering related summer volunteer opportunities. I was able to work with the small group of students, help them assemble their Prusa Mini 3D printer kits, and effectively help them get into the basics of 3D printing.

                <p>
                    I participated as a GunnHacks publicity organizer in the fall of 2023. As my second year, I acted as the lead graphic designer. I set-up the team Figma workplace, and I instigated the main design for the flyer, the bake sale flyer, and the t-shirt design. Along with organizing, I also held the Unity Workshop, teaching participants the basics of game design and programming in C#. In January, I flew out alone to California to help out at the event in person. There, I contributed the post-it mural, and gave the highly anticipated Unity workshop.

                    I gave a small workshop on the basics of 3D printing and computer-aided design to undergraduate students at Stony Brook University. The workshop consisted of a presentation on the principles of designing models for 3D printing with tangible examples from my own projects, and a live demonstration of CAD using Autodesk Inventor.

                <p>
                    I joined GunnHacks as an organizer in the fall of 2021. I worked as a member of the publicity team, and designed aspects of the flyer and t-shirt. This experience was instrumental in developing my graphic design skills, and I would continue to play a larger role as an organizer in later years.

                    I participated in GunnHacks on a team with 3 other of my close friends. After a few hours of brainstorming, we came up with the idea of Well Chess but Actually No, a two-player online chess platform with the twist of being able to add funny or game-changing rules to every match. I acted as the general project manager, coordinated the team, and wrote up the final submission. In addition, I composed the music for the game and contributed ideas. I was inspired to become an organizer the following year after this experience.
