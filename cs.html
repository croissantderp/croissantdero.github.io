        <p>
            I first learned how to code using Unity in 9th grade, making video games during the pandemic. I have been an active member of the United Computations Club at Gunn, and an organizer for their annual GunnHacks hackathon since 10th grade. I also have been participating in the Computer Science Club at Ward Melville.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am familiar with, in order of competence: C#, Unity, C, HTML CSS JS, Python, and a bit of Kotlin.

                    <div class="break"></div><p>Every year at Gunn High School, the orchestra holds a white elephant gift exchange. My friend is known for going above and beyond every year, and in 2022, alongside a team of seven others, we sought to make a cover of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Apple!!" target="none">Bad Apple!!</a>, with everything being recreated by us. </p><p>Creating the video was my part, given I had experience in programming video and image processors.</p><p>Using knowledge gained from my previous "Geckoinator" mosaic maker, which replaces pixels in an image with smaller tiled images, I made an adaptation of the software for the new purpose. I inputed the frames of Bad Apple into the software then replace each pixel with a "light" or "dark" image based on brightness. I ran the program in batches of 1000 frames over the span of six days. Once the frames were ready, I utilized <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="none">FFmpeg</a> to stitch the video together.</p>

                    <div class="break"></div><p>Due to my experience in creating musical arrangements and playing violin, I was able to contribute significantly to the musical aspects of the project as well. With 5 violinists, 2 cellos, a trumpet, and voice, we needed to arrange the song for our unique group composition. I started off the arrangement by creating the backbone of the score, adding in all the main rhythms and melodies. Then, my friend finished the arrangement, filling in the gaps, polishing, and proofreading. I recorded the Violin V part using my five string violin for the extra range.</p><p>My final task was to make a credits frame, which I created using my Figma skills, and assisted in design for the bilingual captions. Then the video, audio, captions, and credits, were combined together to produce the final video.</p>

I further pushed my skills by adding two buttons which would be an on/off switch and a button which turns off the motion detector along with their respective indicator lights. After wiring the electronics, I designed a 3D printable shelf and box to mount everything in.</p>

                    <h2>Fractal Generators</h2>
                    <p class="blurb">Two fractal generators in C that I used as challenges to further my skills. Started in 9th grade and revisited in 11th.</p><div class="break"></div><p>When I was taking CS50x, I was introduced to the concept of recursion. With this new knowledge, I wondered if I could use this to make some fractals. The first one I wanted to try was a Sierpinski triangle. After finishing the CS50 assignment for the week, I got to work on my generator using C. The generation method I went for was duplication, I took the previous shape, and added on two more copies of it below.</p>
                    <img loading="lazy" src="./assets/11iter.png" title="11th iteration of the triangle" alt="11th iteration of the triangle" />
                    <div class="break"></div><p>After more than a year, I was messing around with C during a CS club meeting. This time I aimed for the much more difficult dragon curve to recreate. Like the first, I would use C for added challenge. It took me 5 days to complete. Unlike with the first fractal, I had no idea where to start with the dragon curve. Eventually I settled on using a rotational method to create the fractal. </p><p>To convert my idea into code, I decided to draw out my thinking onto paper. I noticed some patterns in the iterations when I drew them out, and came up with a step-by-step algorithm to get the job done.</p>
                    <img loading="lazy" src="./assets/20220929_232428.jpg" title="The work I did to figure out how to generate a dragon curve" alt="The work I did to figure out how to generate a dragon curve" />

He needed someone to develop the software tool, leading myself to help out.

However, we soon realized that for some students, the only computer they have are chromebooks borrowed from their high school. To solve this problem, I rewrote the application in JavaScript and hosted it on Github. It produced nearly identical results with the console app and anyone could easily run it with internet access, maximizing accessibility. </p>

With less than a week left to produce and test the device, I had to work fast, using a combination of old parts from other projects and new parts. The arduino mounted on the body of the spray bottle would turn a servo every 30 minutes. The servo was attached to the spray bottle with zip ties and pulled the trigger with a steel wire. the entire assembly would hang on the top of the gecko cage aimed downwards.</p>

I knew the sizes of all the final pieces I needed, but I had to fit those pieces onto the planks in a way to minimize the amount of planks used. This turned out to be an application of the "bin packing problem", and I did some research into possible solutions. The solution I used was a genetic algorithm, which gradually approaches a solution using a similar process as natural selection. The algorithm got an answer of 7 planks, which after checking with another program, was indeed the minimum amount of planks needed. From this project, one of my main takeaways was how a genetic algorithm could be used to solve difficult problems, without actually "solving" them outright.</p>

                    <p class="blurb">A portfolio website started in 9th grade that you are reading right now.</p><div class="break"></div><p>This is the product of over a year of development, designs, and redesigns. This journey technically started when I took Cs50 in the summer of 2021. The second to last assignment was to make a homepage for yourself using HTML, CSS, and JS. The page I designed at the time was not really a serious attempt at a homepage, and more of a testing ground. The most impressive part of the website was playing Bad Apple in ASCII complete with synced audio. You can find that version of the website <a href="https://croissantderp.github.io/legacy/">here</a>. Some time later, I returned to start a serious attempt at a personal website. Before I could get started though, I wanted to have a design down. At the time, I was into the art-deco style, and wanted to try to emulate that in the design. My first few designs were were focused on blending the content more like a poster than a website.</p>
                    <img loading="lazy" src="./assets/thing.png" title="The first few drafts of the design" alt="The first few drafts of the design" />
                    <p>Unfortunately, my artistic talents were not sufficient for such a complex design. So, I was back to the drawing board. I decided to keep the theme of unique coloration with a deep orange background and blue-red balls as the central element. This version is still up <a href="https://croissantderp.github.io/old-site/">here</a>. I am still relatively proud of this version of the website, especially of the spheres. When the window was wide enough, the pattern would actually repeat itself using some CSS trickery. The projects section also got its general design and categories in this version. Slowly, I continued to improve the design.</p>
                    <img loading="lazy" src="./assets/otherthings.png" title="A few design options for the website" alt="A few design options for the website" />
                    <p>However, because of the complex JS and code involved, this iteration of the website was slow and resource intensive. The projects section was also outdated. The third and current version of the website began with design once again. This time, I wanted to simplify things. I decided to split each category into its own page to make organization more clear. For the new color scheme, I used a mint green background, and white accents. Originally, I was going to use a list type structure for the projects, but it did not work out very well. After extensive versions, I finally settled on the current square tile style with pop-up window description. All designs can be found in the <a href="-https://www.figma.com/file/bTbiHoQps92egsdiF74h4D/website?node-id=0%3A1&t=Cum52vcphZmkAkSU-1">Figma</a>. Implementing this website should have been relatively easy, but it became a nightmare. First, I decided to not use JS at all, and everything had to be HTML CSS. This was the biggest head scratcher of the project. Very few people have attempted to do what I set out to do, probably for good reason too. Somehow against all odds, I ended up with this completely functional website, with no JS! By now, my projects list had grown substantially. I had over 60 different projects that all needed descriptions, links, and photos. This was the other nightmare. If I were to do this completely in the IDE, I might even say it is impossible. Instead, I created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VGOGORdpfTsmgE1BBKo9Q1aXfM9UJjHJve1Rn5N_0qo/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> and wrote out all the information there. Based on this, I wrote another program to convert the spreadsheet into HTML, which could then be copy pasted into the website; and finally, here we are.</p>

To this, I combined Google Drive's own API to download the source images and to automatically store a local backup of them.
