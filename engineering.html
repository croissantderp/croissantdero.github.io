        <h1>Engineering</h1>
        <p>
            I began this journey in 8th grade with my first 3D printer, and learned steadily through various projects, which broadly fell in three categories: 1) printable tools for lab research, 2) designs for school activities, and 3) various creations for use at home.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am part of the Ward Melville robotics team, and served as the head of CAD. The software I am familiar with and use regularly are, Autodesk Inventor, Fusion, Onshape, and Ultimaker Cura. The materials I have been experimenting with range from plastics, to wood, to metals, and carbon fiber.

                    <div class="break"></div><p>One of my proundest designs so far. I designed a new joinery for modulization of 3D-printed items, by adding my own touch on the historical dovetail joint of woodworking. I coined the term "Spring Dovetail" for it.</p><p> An extra curved spring layer is added in the dovetail junction to buffer printing errors and prevent over-tight/loose engagement.</p>

                    <div class="break"></div><p>A good application of my Spring Dovetail design is for a system of modularized tube rack sets. Existing commercial products consist of a single molded part with large foorprint. This makes them difficult to use, especially when many tube types are required in the experiments. I thus designed modularized racks which can connect together via Spring Dovetail. The spring tension is fine-tuned to be just right so the block unis could be connected and disconnected without much hassle and still stay together.</p>

                    <div class="break"></div><p>A freezer accidentally left with an unclosed door is the most feared nightmare in the lab. I designed this latch to ensure a door is properly shut and stays shut. Each unit consists of a base which mounts to the side of the target object, an L shaped bar to lock the fridge, and a stopper to adjust the working length of the bar. It only cost 43 cents to make one.</p>

                    <div class="break"></div><p>Later, I added a new variant for the opposite purpose, to prevent a door from being accidentaly opened. The new design added a 'push-and-turn" unlocking mechanism. Without unlocking first, the door will stay shut when trying to open the door with an pulling force outward. This is especially useful for protecting lab equipment from accidental collisions. </p><p></p>

                    <div class="break"></div><p> Feeding of research animal is a critical variable that needs to be tightly controled in labs. It is frequently a selection between manual feeding (which is affordable but inconsistent) and automatic feeders (which are precise but very expensive). To break this dilemma, I designed manual feeders as a good middle ground solution between full manual feeding and automatic feeders. Make feeding easier, faster, and more consistent.</p><p>The whole apparatus is comprised of a funnel which connects to the tank, an adapter, and the single-print feeder. The funnels fit various size of tanks, providing a universal base for the feeder. The feeder stores food in a upper hopper, which feeds into a rotating compartment. When the lever is pushed, this compartment rotates and dispenses the food. The the inlet and outlet of the rotating compartment is offset in such a way that food is only allowed to either flow in or flow out, but never at the same time. This guarantees that the amount of food dispensed per lever push is consistent.</p>

                    <p class="blurb">A modularized holder set that can be used broadly for multiple purposes in the lab.

                    <div class="break"></div><p> Space is one of the most precious properties in the lab. It is thus important to maximize the use of lab space without comprimising convenience and functionality. To fit into different lab settings, I designed the multi-purpose holders with variable bases. </p><p>The fixed bases offer convenience to directly mount to common shelves and tables. The adjustable bases allow the same holder to be flexibly applied on different surfaces. The holders can work independently to hold large items such as pipettes, scissors, tools, clothes & bags, as well as arranging wires and cords. </p><p>The holders can also couple with adaptors to further expand their fucntions, for instance, an O-ring to hold smaller items such as tweezers, or a common lab 50ml tube for placing pens and scalpels.</p>

                    <div class="break"></div><p>I love this project because of its usefulness and direct impact on research. Most of the commercially available counterparts are ridiculously expensive. One good example is the pipette holder, which usually charges >$150 for simply a piece of plastic and are incompataible between brands. All these cause hurdles of research accessibility. With that in mind, I specifically chose to work with the pipette head knob, as it is the component shared by most of the brands. I then designed an additional adaptor to cover the other brands without the head knob. </p><p></p>

                    <div class="break"></div><p>Important to note, for the same reason, I prioritize designs that can be robustly printed even with consumer-grade printers. For instance, this design is designed to be completely printable without support material, saving material and hassle. Consequently, most of my printed objects look simple instead of fancy. And everyone can print and use them in their research easily. </p><p>This is a open-end project and I continue to expand the sets. One of the later addition is the version that can be taped or screwed on flat surface.</p>

                    <div class="break"></div><p> This is one of my many projects to engineer specialized function on consumer-grade microscopes. </p><p>In microscopy, epi- and trans-illuminations are used for opaque and transparent specimen respectively (defined by whether the light source and the detector on the same or opposite side of specimen). Microscopes usually only equip with one of the two. It is thus tricky to image both transparent and non-transparent specimen at the same time. </p><p>To solve this problem, I designed an adaptor to attach commonly found commercial ring LEDs around the lens, to achieve the goal of having both trans- and epi-illuminiation at the same time.</p>

These features, along with built-in tick marks as the length reference, allow the length of fish in images to be easily converted into real body length. Despite its simplicity, it is one of the most used designs in the lab.</p>

                    <div class="break"></div><p>The idea was to develop a home-grown swerve drive for the Ward Melville robotics team. Swerve drive is a type of drive system in robotics where each wheel can be individually steered. It grants significant maneuvering advantages and thus is broadly used by most high level teams. This prototype was produced as a proof of feasibility to the rest of the team. </p><p>After researching swerve, I chose differential swerve as the target drive system. A differential swerve would have greater power using both motors to steer and drive, and each module has a lower part count meaning it would be easier to manufacture. </p><p>As a warm-up project, I started off with a traditional swerve drive, designed with fusion 360. </p>

                    <div class="break"></div><p>The idea was to understand how a hydraulic system works and the engineering, physics, and math behind it. Each team of two in the class was given a limited budget to build their arm within.  To pursue maximum functionality and cost-effectiveness, I created the entire design via 3D printing.</p>

                    <div class="break"></div><p>To ensure stability when lifting heavy objects, a wide legged base was used. Sitting on the base was the turntable, the most complex piece of engineering in the project. To have full 360 rotation, I designed a planetary gearbox hidden in the central stack that steps up the travel of a small 9 cm syringe, the hydraulic piston, to significantly more movement.</p>

                    <div class="break"></div><p>The arm structure is optimized for a balance between strength and movement, and was pressure-tested using simulations and scale prototypes. To increase strength and rigidity, I used Autodesk Inventor's built in generative design feature. This process produced the unique geometry of each segment. </p>
                    <div class="break"></div><p>My experince from other projects provides a technical foundation for this design. I used planetary gears from the gearbox project, low friction guide rails from the microscope gliding table, and integrated usage of hardware. I also got to learn several new techniques, including generative design using Inventor, a workflow between different software, and compliant joints. Another new technique I developed was making professional <a href="https://croissantderp.github.io/assets/hydraulicArmSketches.pdf">engineering drawings</a>, which I made for every part designed in this project.</p><p>After the end of the project, I took the arm home to display. Later, the design was repurposed for holding up a Lego Saturn V moon rocket. Minor upgrades have been made to improve strength and durability for this purpose.</p>

With my interests in electronics, and lack of variety in pre-built laptops, I made my own, a self-built laptop. </p><p>Self-built laptops are farily rare. This is mostly because compact computer parts are rarely sold, especially not in a form meant for DIY hobbyists. Thus, as a base to work on, the Raspberry Pi stood out as the best option available, being small, efficient, and reasonably powerful. </p><p>I composed my laptop with two modules. One is the compute module including a Raspberry Pi 4 powered by a 40000mAh battery and a breadboard for electronics.

The design process was significantly more rigorous than it appears. Space efficiency was key. Every part had to fit perfectly using minimum space. The shell of the display module was a legitimate challenge to make and assemble. The margin of error is extremly small. The sensitive touchscreens needed to be delicately pressed and secured into the shell. The wiring for both monitors also needed to be run through an internal channel and carefully linked up.</p>

It directly drove the fan for the prototypes, and was changed to driving a gear chain in order to save space in the final version. The intake features a velocity stack as a part of the lid which ensures smoother airflow into the fan.</p><p>To see how far I could push the small DC motor, I designed a remix of the project based on a turbocharger. The impeller for the turbo is one of the most complex shapes I have ever 3D printed. almost all of it was produced in Autodesk Inventor using layered 3D sketches and lofting them together. </p>

                <div class="break"></div><p>As my robotics team began preparing for the Long Island Regional competition, I had an idea to make a toy train that advertised the team in our pit area. The foundation of my design is GeoTrax, a discontinued train set that I loved when I was younger, and it was my goal to make a fully compatible train. </p><p>In the short time before the competition, I intended to design a locomotive and one rail car. I started off with designing the wheels: a universal component on the project. I tested multiple different profiles, tweaking the angle and flange size until the wheels could handle curves without derailing. Knowing my car would be significantly longer than any intended for GeoTrax, I implemented a system of bogies, or individually rotating sets of wheels, to handle narrow turns. </p>

                <div class="break"></div><p>the locomotive was significantly more complicated than I anticipated. I started off simple with creating the chassis and something that could roll. 3D printed shafts would not rotate smoothly, so I commissioned my friend ahead of time to machine some aluminium D shafts for the wheels. The locomotive primarily used a cog to move, which engages with a matching rack on the track. Like my wheels, it took several iterations to get the cog to engage smoothly. All this was driven by a cheap brushed motor, powered by 4 AA batteries in a 3D printed battery pack. To transmit torque from the motor to the wheels, I designed a 4 gear chain connected to the drive axle. </p>

                <div class="break"></div><p>The night before the competition, I tested it for the first time. I placed it on the track, and it proceeded to stall out after moving a few centimeters. With little time, I printed another motor module and mounted a second motor on top of the first. To balance out the train and to give it a bit more weight, I taped some heavy bolts on both front and back of the train. I packed everything into a filament box, and got ready for the next day. </p><p>At the competition, I set up the train to run in a loop on one of our tables, and it succesfully showed off our team.</p>

The Society needed a 3D architectural model for demonstrational purposes and I was contacted by my engineering teacher to fulfill this project. </p><p>The first issue I needed to address was how large to make the replica. It needed to be as large as possible, but both the house and the property it sits on had to be within the capabilities of my 3D printer. The best balance I found was at 1:100, printing the property in two pieces which would then be joined together. Using the architectural drawings provided to me, I carefully modeled a scale replica of the building using the given dimensions. For the property, I used a plat map to create a a model to the same scale as the barn. After these were printed, I handed the completed project to the engineering teacher who delivered it to the Historical Society.</p>

Usually the solution would be to add another z-axis motor on the sagging side, but I did not have another stepper motor and Monoprice did not design the printer to accommodate that. The solution I came up with was to make a pulley system that transfers the height from the stable side to the sagging side. </p>

With less than a week left to produce and test the device, I had to work fast, using a combination of old parts from other projects and new parts. The arduino mounted on the body of the spray bottle would turn a servo every 30 minutes. The servo was attached to the spray bottle with zip ties and pulled the trigger with a steel wire. the entire assembly would hang on the top of the gecko cage aimed downwards.</p>

To roll, I designed wheeled segments that suspended the curtain below. It worked very well after I installed it, and it was easy to roll the curtain back and forth. </p><p>Later, this project would discover an alternative use as well. I needed a way to suspend a 3d printed moon from the ceiling as part of my moon rocket diorama for the hydraulic arm. Instead of creating a new system from scratch, I recycled the curtain rod and flipped it upside-down it to act like a pulley instead. The pulleys let me raise and lower the height of the moon easily. Then, I printed a mount to stick it onto the ceiling which rotated so I could adjust the position of the moon. The segments also received some strengthening sleeves to keep them from breaking.</p>

As a result of the length of the arm, it uses two mounting slots for added rigidity.</p>

                <div class="break"></div><p>After a crack developed in one of the wooden sides of my electric violin, a regular shoulder rest would no longer work, and I needed a new one.</p><p>There was no commerical product that fit my unique needs, so I designed everything from scratch. The result was a shoulder rest which mounts on the central body of the violin instead of the sides, thereby not putting any stress on the cracked wooden sides. The mounting point is a two-part 3D printed clip which snaps in place and provides a stable mounting point. A pin is then used to connect it to a large curved part which is designed to fit my shoulder shape.</p>

I could also use the cage of my old bearded dragon, but it was missing a lid and discontinued. The most cost-effective solution I found was to build my own cage. I first decided on a design by drawing it out in Inventor. Once complete, I cut acrylic panels for the sides and assembled them with aquarium sealant.</p>

After a year of service, I cleaned it out and repaired some damaged sealant, altogether it has held together remarkably well.</p>

The extension consists of a clip which mounts to the stand and a shelf below and the design is a single 3D printable piece. The completed module is able to hold a metronome and a few pencils. It is pictured below with my personalized conductor's baton.</p>
