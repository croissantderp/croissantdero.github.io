                    The final project of my Principles of Engineering class. I worked with a partner and was in change of designing and printing the physical structures. This arm uses multiple techniques from previous projects, the planetary gears from the gearbox project, guide rails from the microscope plate, and integrated usage of bolts. I also got to use several new techniques, generative design using inventor, a workflow between different software, and compliant mechanisms. The project required me to submit professional drawings which I had to learn to make. My partner was in charge of all the electronics for the electromagnet mounted at the end of the arm, and I helped out with the batteries and mounts. In the final competition, this arm got second place out of the entire class.

                    A semi-automatic fish feeder made for a lab. It is comprised of a funnel which connects to the tank, an adapter, and the single-print feeder.

                    The feeder stores food in a upper hopper, which feeds into a rotating compartment. When the lever is pushed, this compartment rotates and dispenses the food.

                    A gliding table for microscopes. It is comprised of three plates driven by a rack and pinion system. Guide rails are used to reduce friction while keeping vibration to a minimum.

                    A custom shoulder rest designed for my YEV-105 electric violin after a crack developed in one of the wooden sides. It mounts on the central body of the violin and does not put stress on the crack. This is one of my most difficult projects in terms of the geometry involved.
