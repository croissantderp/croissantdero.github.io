        <h1>Art</h1>
        <p>
            I have played violin since kindergarten and later branched into music composition and arrangement. I also picked up my sewing skills from my grandma and mom around 3rd grade and started projects in middle school. I was introduced to graphic design with Figma during the pandemic, and later oversaw the visual design for GunnHacks, the annual hackathon hosted by Gunn High School.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am a member of the Ward Melville Orchestra. I practice art in the forms of music, fabric, graphic design, and drawing.

Done for the holiday season of 11th grade.</p><p><iframe height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OBxSdhrX5n8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
                <div class="break"></div><p>Every year at Gunn High School, the orchestra holds a white elephant gift exchange. My friend is known for going above and beyond every year, and in 2022, alongside a team of seven others, we sought to make a cover of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Apple!!" target="none">Bad Apple!!</a>, with everything being recreated by us. </p><p>Creating the video was my part, given I had experience in programming video and image processors.</p><p>Using knowledge gained from my previous "Geckoinator" mosaic maker, which replaces pixels in an image with smaller tiled images, I made an adaptation of the software for the new purpose. I inputed the frames of Bad Apple into the software then replace each pixel with a "light" or "dark" image based on brightness. I ran the program in batches of 1000 frames over the span of six days. Once the frames were ready, I utilized <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="none">FFmpeg</a> to stitch the video together.</p>

                <div class="break"></div><p>Due to my experience in creating musical arrangements and playing violin, I was able to contribute significantly to the musical aspects of the project as well. With 5 violinists, 2 cellos, a trumpet, and voice, we needed to arrange the song for our unique group composition. I started off the arrangement by creating the backbone of the score, adding in all the main rhythms and melodies. Then, my friend finished the arrangement, filling in the gaps, polishing, and proofreading. I recorded the Violin V part using my five string violin for the extra range.</p><p>My final task was to make a credits frame, which I created using my Figma skills, and assisted in design for the bilingual captions. Then the video, audio, captions, and credits, were combined together to produce the final video.</p>

                <h2>croissantderp.github.io</h2>
                <p class="blurb">A portfolio website started in 9th grade that you are reading right now.</p><div class="break"></div><p>This is the product of over a year of development, designs, and redesigns. This journey technically started when I took Cs50 in the summer of 2021. The second to last assignment was to make a homepage for yourself using HTML, CSS, and JS. The page I designed at the time was not really a serious attempt at a homepage, and more of a testing ground. The most impressive part of the website was playing Bad Apple in ASCII complete with synced audio. You can find that version of the website <a href="https://croissantderp.github.io/legacy/">here</a>. Some time later, I returned to start a serious attempt at a personal website. Before I could get started though, I wanted to have a design down. At the time, I was into the art-deco style, and wanted to try to emulate that in the design. My first few designs were were focused on blending the content more like a poster than a website.</p>
                <img loading="lazy" src="./assets/thing.png" title="The first few drafts of the design" alt="The first few drafts of the design" />
                <p>Unfortunately, my artistic talents were not sufficient for such a complex design. So, I was back to the drawing board. I decided to keep the theme of unique coloration with a deep orange background and blue-red balls as the central element. This version is still up <a href="https://croissantderp.github.io/old-site/">here</a>. I am still relatively proud of this version of the website, especially of the spheres. When the window was wide enough, the pattern would actually repeat itself using some CSS trickery. The projects section also got its general design and categories in this version. Slowly, I continued to improve the design.</p>
                <img loading="lazy" src="./assets/otherthings.png" title="A few design options for the website" alt="A few design options for the website" />
                <p>However, because of the complex JS and code involved, this iteration of the website was slow and resource intensive. The projects section was also outdated. The third and current version of the website began with design once again. This time, I wanted to simplify things. I decided to split each category into its own page to make organization more clear. For the new color scheme, I used a mint green background, and white accents. Originally, I was going to use a list type structure for the projects, but it did not work out very well. After extensive versions, I finally settled on the current square tile style with pop-up window description. All designs can be found in the <a href="-https://www.figma.com/file/bTbiHoQps92egsdiF74h4D/website?node-id=0%3A1&t=Cum52vcphZmkAkSU-1">Figma</a>. Implementing this website should have been relatively easy, but it became a nightmare. First, I decided to not use JS at all, and everything had to be HTML CSS. This was the biggest head scratcher of the project. Very few people have attempted to do what I set out to do, probably for good reason too. Somehow against all odds, I ended up with this completely functional website, with no JS! By now, my projects list had grown substantially. I had over 60 different projects that all needed descriptions, links, and photos. This was the other nightmare. If I were to do this completely in the IDE, I might even say it is impossible. Instead, I created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VGOGORdpfTsmgE1BBKo9Q1aXfM9UJjHJve1Rn5N_0qo/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> and wrote out all the information there. Based on this, I wrote another program to convert the spreadsheet into HTML, which could then be copy pasted into the website; and finally, here we are.</p>

For our project, we decided to make online chess, but with a twist! There would be a set of bonus rules which can be added to each game and combined to create a unique experience. My role in this project was management and music, and I also contributed to the code, art, design, and ideas.</p>

                <p class="blurb">A fullbody wearable velvet cloak started around 8th grade.</p><div class="break"></div><p>Around 2020, the Joann in Palo Alto closed. Before closing, they had a grand sale of everything left on their shelves and I went with my mom to check it out. On one of these expeditions, I found a bolt of turquoise velvet and I wanted to make a cloak with it. </p><p>Before getting started, I researched how to make cloaks. After figuring out that you need a semicircle of fabric. I used Autocad to draw a suitable design that would fit on the piece of velvet I had. Then, with help from my mom, I made sewing patterns  to assist cutting out the cloak. </p><p>Over winter break, I used a combination of sewing machine and hand sowing to stitch the parts together. After the cloak itself was complete, I needed a clasp to finish it. I could not find anything that I enjoyed online, so I decided to 3D print my own. I designed a modular clasp that let me design decorative elements in the future which could then attach to the existing clasp. In the fall of 2022, I decided to make some changes after moving to New York. Because of the much colder winters, I bought some warm fabric to line the inside of the cloak. After sewing that on, I finished by finally sowing the clasp onto the cloak.</p>

The original purpose was as a decoration for my geckos, but it works just as well as a desk ornament.</p><p>Inventor is not intended to be used for artistic purposes, but the symmetry of the fountain simplified the process. The result is one of the most complex designs I have ever made in terms of feature count. This project allowed me to fully explore the suite of tools Inventor offered. I learned how to use the loft feature for complicated 3D geometry, and combine multiple tools to produce fine details. The whole fountain is 3D printed in a eight parts which simply fit together.</p>

                <p class="blurb">An arrangement of "Megalovania" by Toby Fox created in 7th grade.</p><div class="break"></div><p>I made this arrangement in 7th grade when I was into the video game "Undertale". This was one of my earliest projects using Musescore to write music scores, and I picked up a lot of skills in the process. After I was satisfied with the product, I was interested in playing it in the school orchestra. I pitched this to the director, and the orchestra sightread through my arrangement. Later on, I brought this arrangement back for a summer music camp I interned at. This project was the inception for my interest in arranging music. <iframe src="https://musescore.com/user/24338771/scores/5939336/embed" title="Musescore"></iframe></p>

                <div class="break"></div><p>In early 2019, I had recently learnt how to crochet from my grandma. I wanted to test my skills, so I decided to crochet a roll-up scarf. I had to make the scarf itself, then a band which could be used to keep the scarf rolled up. I worked whenever I had free time, and finished in about a month. After finishing, my dad bought the scarf for $20.</p>
